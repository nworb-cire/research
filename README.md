# Research

This repository contains one-off research projects that tickle my interest. 
These projects generally involve computational mathematics or machine learning.

You will find PDFs, Jupyter notebooks (which github can display), and [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks, 
which you may need to run locally to properly view.
